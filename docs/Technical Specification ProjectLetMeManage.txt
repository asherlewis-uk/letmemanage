1. Executive Summary
LetMeManage is a distributed computing framework designed to decouple the user's digital environment from physical hardware constraints. By establishing a high-performance, role-based "Tether" between devices, LetMeGo enables a low-power client (The Satellite - LetMeGo-satellite) to seamlessly utilize the storage, processing, and graphical power of a high-performance host (The Host - LetMeStay).
Unlike traditional remote desktop solutions, LetMeGo focuses on application-level virtualization and filesystem unification, creating a user experience where the remote machine feels like a native extension of the local hardware.

Architecture Status (February 2026):
• Core tether architecture: ✓ Implemented
• System tray integration: ✓ Complete (both applications run silently in background)
• Smart visibility logic: ✓ Operational (UI shows only when check_connection_status() returns false)
• Workspace structure: ✓ Verified (letmego-core, letmestay-anchor, letmego-satellite)

2. System Architecture
The architecture is defined by two distinct roles. A device must be assigned one of these roles during the initialization phase.
Feature	LetMeStay (Host)	LetMeGo-satellite (Client)
Folder Name	letmestay-anchor	letmego-satellite
Primary Role	Compute, Render, Store	Display, Input, Request
Power Profile	High TDP / AC Power	Low TDP / Battery Optimized
Hardware	GPU-enabled, High RAM	SoC (ARM/x86), High-Res Screen
State	Persistent	Ephemeral / Stateless
UI Behavior	Silent start (hidden unless not connected)	Silent start (hidden unless not connected)
System Tray	"LetMeStay - Host"	"LetMeGo - Remote Client"
2.1 LetMeStay (Host) Responsibilities
•	System Tray Controller: Runs as a background service with tray icon ("LetMeStay - Host"). Starts with visible: false in tauri.conf.json.
•	Smart Window Manager: Automatically shows UI on startup only if check_connection_status() returns false (not connected). Otherwise remains hidden.
•	Virtual Display Driver: Creates headless monitor instances to stream content without physically waking the host screen.
•	Video Encoder: Captures framebuffers and encodes to H.264/HEVC/AV1.
•	Input Injection: Receives remote HID (Human Interface Device) commands and injects them into the OS kernel.
•	Secure Listener: Background service listening for Wake-on-LAN (WoL) "heartbeats" and connection handshakes.
•	Tether Key Generator: Generates Ed25519 keypairs and 6-digit pairing codes for satellite devices.
2.2 LetMeGo-satellite (Client) Responsibilities
•	System Tray Controller: Runs as a background service with tray icon ("LetMeGo - Remote Client"). Starts with visible: false in tauri.conf.json.
•	Smart Window Manager: Automatically shows UI on startup only if check_connection_status() returns false (not tethered). Otherwise remains hidden.
•	Stream Decoder: Hardware-accelerated video decoding.
•	Input Hook: Intercepts local keyboard/mouse events and transmits them over the tunnel.
•	Virtual Filesystem: Mounts the LetMeStay host's storage directories as local network drives.
•	State Manager: Monitors lid position and network availability to manage the connection state.
•	Tether Key Input: Accepts 6-digit pairing codes to establish connection with LetMeStay hosts.

2.3 LetMeGo-core (Shared Library)
•	Folder: letmego-core
•	Cryptographic Primitives: Ed25519 keypair generation and TetherKey management (base64 encoding/decoding).
•	Network Protocol Wrappers: WireGuard tunnel configuration and management.
•	Configuration Manager: Reading/writing local JSON/TOML config files to ~/.LetMeGo/config.
•	Shared between both LetMeStay and LetMeGo-satellite applications.

4. Core Feature Specifications
Feature A: "Ghost Apps" (The RAIL Protocol) — PLANNED
•	Concept: Remote Applications Integrated Locally.
•	Technical Implementation:
	○	Window Capture: LetMeStay captures specific application window handles (HWND/WindowID) rather than the entire desktop.
	○	Alpha Blending: The stream background is rendered transparent.
	○	Client Decoration: The Satellite renders its native OS window borders around the incoming video stream.
	○	Result: A Windows-based heavy application appears as a native window on a macOS or Linux laptop, respecting local window management (snapping, minimizing).
Feature B: "The Infinity Drive" (Virtual Filesystem) — PLANNED
•	Concept: Zero-space storage expansion.
•	Technical Implementation:
	○	Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE/Dokan): Creates a virtual drive on the Satellite.
	○	Metadata Caching: The Satellite downloads a lightweight index of the LetMeStay host's file structure (directory tree only).
	○	On-Demand Streaming: Files are only transferred (streamed) when opened. Writes are cached locally and uploaded asynchronously to the LetMeStay host.
Feature C: "Smart Wake" (The Heartbeat) — PLANNED
•	Concept: Automated power management.
•	Technical Implementation:
	○	Lid State Detection: When the Satellite laptop opens, it broadcasts a UDP "Magic Packet" to the LetMeStay host's specific MAC address.
	○	Keep-Alive: While the Satellite is active, it sends a low-frequency heartbeat signal.
	○	Auto-Sleep: If the Satellite disconnects or closes, the LetMeStay host waits for a timeout period and then returns to Sleep/Suspend mode to conserve energy.

Feature D: "Silent Operation" (System Tray Integration) — ✓ IMPLEMENTED
•	Concept: Background operation with smart UI visibility.
•	Technical Implementation:
	○	Both LetMeStay and LetMeGo-satellite start with visible: false in tauri.conf.json.
	○	System tray icons provide manual access: "LetMeStay - Host" and "LetMeGo - Remote Client".
	○	Smart Trigger: UI automatically appears only if check_connection_status() returns false.
	○	Tray Menu: Show window, quit application.
	○	Result: Zero UI clutter when already connected; automatic setup prompt when configuration needed.

6. Business Case & Market Strategy
6.1 Market Problem
•	Device Fragmentation: Users own powerful desktops (now served by LetMeStay) but are forced to use inferior laptops when mobile (now served by LetMeGo-satellite).
•	Sync Fatigue: Managing files across OneDrive, Dropbox, and local drives creates versioning conflicts. The Infinity Drive (planned) solves this with unified filesystem.
•	Hardware Cost: Users "buy the same computer twice" (a desktop for power, a laptop for travel). LetMeGo eliminates this by making the desktop accessible from any client device.
•	UI Clutter: Traditional remote desktop tools are always visible. LetMeStay/LetMeGo-satellite run silently in system tray, appearing only when needed.
6.2 Target Demographics
•	The "Power Creative": Video editors and 3D artists who need RTX-level power at a coffee shop but only own a MacBook Air.
•	The Student/Gamer: Users who have a gaming rig in their dorm but take a cheap Chromebook to class.
•	The Developer: Engineers who need a specific Linux environment compilation host accessible from any terminal.
6.3 Monetization Model (Freemium SaaS)
•	Tier 1: LetMeGo/LetMeStay Core (Free)
	○	Standard Desktop Mirroring (Full Screen).
	○	Local Network Connections Only (LAN).
